Welcome to my blog!

I have finally gotten tired of fussing around with CSS, and so have started this version of my Jekyll blog with the pre-packaged Minima theme.
The new plan is to focus on making it functional.
After it's functional, I'll make it pretty. And musical.

As it is Cyber Monday, and I need to be thrifty, I plan to purchase a domain name at a bargain price.
It would be nice to get an email address to go along with it.
Unfortunately, I might be too late in the game to get all of the deals.

I shall wait for coupons anyway!

*The next post shall contain more about the process of making my blog, including some of my trials and tribulations.*
